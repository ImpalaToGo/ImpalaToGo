            regionserver checks in soon after master start while all the rest in the
            cluster are laggardly, this first server to checkin will be assigned all
            regions.  If lots of regions, this first server could buckle under the
            load.  To prevent the above scenario happening up the

              another Master has assumed the role of primary.

This means
              that if a server crashes, it will be three minutes before the Master notices
              the crash and starts recovery. You might like to tune the timeout down to
              a minute or even less so the Master notices failures the sooner.
              Before changing this value, be sure you have your JVM garbage collection
              configuration under control otherwise, a long garbage collection that lasts
              beyond the ZooKeeper session timeout will take out
              your RegionServer (You might be fine with this -- you probably want recovery to start
          on the server if a RegionServer has been in GC for a long period of time).</p><p>To change this configuration, edit <code class="filename">hbase-site.xml</code>,
          copy the changed file around the cluster and restart.</p><p>We set this value high to save our having to field noob questions up on the mailing lists asking
              why a RegionServer went down during a massive import.  The usual cause is that their JVM is untuned and
              they are running into long GC pauses.  Our thinking is that
              while users are  getting familiar with HBase, we'd save them having to know all of its
              intricacies.  Later when they've built some confidence, then they can play
              with configuration such as this.

                  description.  If you have &gt; three or four disks, you might want to set this to 1 or if you have many disks,
                  two or more.

          This setting defines the number of threads that are kept open to answer
          incoming requests to user tables. The rule of thumb is to keep this
          number low when the payload per request approaches the MB (big puts, scans using
          a large cache) and high when the payload is small (gets, small puts, ICVs, deletes).
          The total size of the queries in progress is limited  by the setting
          "ipc.server.max.callqueue.size".
          </p><p>
          It is safe to set that number to the
          maximum number of incoming clients if their payload is small, the typical example
          being a cluster that serves a website since puts aren't typically buffered
          and most of the operations are gets.
          </p><p>
          The reason why it is dangerous to keep this setting high is that the aggregate
          size of all the puts that are currently happening in a region server may impose
          too much pressure on its memory, or even trigger an OutOfMemoryError. A region server
          running on low memory will trigger its JVM's garbage collector to run more frequently
          up to a point where GC pauses become noticeable (the reason being that all the memory
          used to keep all the requests' payloads cannot be trashed, no matter how hard the
          garbage collector tries). After some time, the overall cluster
          throughput is affected since every request that hits that region server will take longer,
          which exacerbates the problem even more.

          HBase ships with a reasonable, conservative configuration that will
          work on nearly all
          machine types that people might want to test with. If you have larger
          machines -- HBase has 8G and larger heap -- you might the following configuration options helpful.

There are several options that are near-frictionless and in most all cases boost
      performance by reducing the size of StoreFiles and thus reducing I/O.

These WAL files should be configured to be slightly smaller than HDFS block (by default, HDFS block is 64Mb and WAL file is ~60Mb).</p><p>HBase also has a limit on number of WAL files, designed to ensure there's never too much data that needs to be replayed during recovery. This limit needs to be set according to memstore configuration, so that all the necessary data would fit. It is recommended to allocated enough WAL files to store at least that much data (when all memstores are close to full).
      For example, with 16Gb RS heap, default memstore settings (0.4), and default WAL file size (~60Mb), 16Gb*0.4/60, the starting point for WAL file count is ~109.
      However, as all memstores are not expected to be full all the time, less WAL files can be allocated.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.5.2.7.&nbsp;Managed Splitting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="disable.splitting"></a>1.5.2.7.&nbsp;Managed Splitting</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Rather than let HBase auto-split your Regions, manage the splitting manually
      <sup>[<a name="d4651e2594" href="#ftn.d4651e2594" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup>.
 With growing amounts of data, splits will continually be needed. Since
 you always know exactly what regions you have, long-term debugging and
 profiling is much easier with manual splits. It is hard to trace the logs to
 understand region level problems if it keeps splitting and getting renamed.
 Data offlining bugs + unknown number of split regions == oh crap! If an
 <code class="classname">HLog</code> or <code class="classname">StoreFile</code>
 was mistakenly unprocessed by HBase due to a weird bug and
 you notice it a day or so later, you can be assured that the regions
 specified in these files are the same as the current regions and you have
 less headaches trying to restore/replay your data.
 You can finely tune your compaction algorithm. With roughly uniform data
 growth, it's easy to cause split / compaction storms as the regions all
 roughly hit the same data size at the same time. With manual splits, you can
 let staggered, time-based major compactions spread out your network IO load.
      </p><p>
 How do I turn off automatic splitting? Automatic splitting is determined by the configuration value
 <code class="code">hbase.hregion.max.filesize</code>. It is not recommended that you set this
 to <code class="varname">Long.MAX_VALUE</code> in case you forget about manual splits. A suggested setting
 is 100GB, which would result in &gt; 1hr major compactions if reached.
 </p><p>What's the optimal number of pre-split regions to create?
 Mileage will vary depending upon your application.
 You could start low with 10 pre-split regions / server and watch as data grows
 over time. It's better to err on the side of too little regions and rolling split later.
 A more complicated answer is that this depends upon the largest storefile
 in your region. With a growing data size, this will get larger over time. You
 want the largest region to be just big enough that the <code class="classname">Store</code> compact
 selection algorithm only compacts it due to a timed major. If you don't, your
 cluster can be prone to compaction storms as the algorithm decides to run
 major compactions on a large series of regions all at once. Note that
 compaction storms are due to the uniform data growth, not the manual split
 decision.
 </p><p> If you pre-split your regions too thin, you can increase the major compaction
interval by configuring <code class="varname">HConstants.MAJOR_COMPACTION_PERIOD</code>. If your data size
grows too large, use the (post-0.90.0 HBase) <code class="classname">org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.RegionSplitter</code>
script to perform a network IO safe rolling split
of all regions.

      HBase do it.  By default, <code class="varname">HConstants.MAJOR_COMPACTION_PERIOD</code> is one day and major compactions
      may kick in when you least desire it - especially on a busy system.  To turn off automatic major compactions set
      the value to <code class="varname">0</code>.
      </p><p>It is important to stress that major compactions are absolutely necessary for StoreFile cleanup, the only variant is when
      they occur.  They can be administered through the HBase shell, or via
      <a class="link" href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HBaseAdmin.html#majorCompact%28java.lang.String%29" target="_top">HBaseAdmin</a>.

        Speculative Execution at a system-level unless you need it for a specific case, where it can be configured per-job.

        <code class="varname">mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution</code> to false.

           indices over and over again.  If your working set it such that block cache does you no good, at least
           size the block cache such that hfile indices will stay up in the cache (you can get a rough idea
           on the size you need by surveying regionserver UIs; you'll see index block size accounted near the
