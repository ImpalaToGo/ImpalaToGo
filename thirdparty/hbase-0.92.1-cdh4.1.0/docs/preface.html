          If this is your first foray into the wonderful world of
          Distributed Computing, then you are in for
          some interesting times.  First off, distributed systems are
          hard; making a distributed system hum requires a disparate
          skillset that needs span systems (hardware and software) and
          networking.  Your cluster' operation can hiccup because of any
          of a myriad set of reasons from bugs in HBase itself through misconfigurations
          -- misconfiguration of HBase but also operating system misconfigurations --
          through to hardware problems whether it be a bug in your network card
          drivers or an underprovisioned RAM bus (to mention two recent
          examples of hardware issues that manifested as "HBase is slow").
          You will also need to do a recalibration if up to this your
          computing has been bound to a single box.  Here is one good
          starting point:
